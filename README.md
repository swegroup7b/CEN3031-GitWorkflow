**Note : The goal of this session is to adopt yourself to the workflow rather than focus on programming. Each group member must commit at least once before the end of this session**

## Steps:-

### Scrum Master  
1. Create an organization
2. Add all group mates to the organization
3. Fork the current repo and add this to your organization so that all members use this as a starter template
4. Currently this repo has a master (trunk) branch. Create the branches required for usual workflow - Test, Development, Feature 1 (Subtract), Feature 2 (Multiply) and Feature 3 (Divide).
..* Hint: Use these commands
```
git branch test
git checkout test
git branch development
git checkout development
git branch subtract
git branch multiply
git branch divide
```
### Team members including scrum master 

1. 2 members will work on subtract branch to implement view and javascript function. 
2. 2 members will work on multiply branch to implement view and javascript function. 
3. 2 members will work on divide branch to implement view and javascript function. 
4. Once a feature branch is completed by 2 members, they will create a pull request to make sure someone from the team reviews their code and merges this into the develop branch.
